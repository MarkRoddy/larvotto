Larvotto is an AOL instant messanger bot that utilizes markov chains 
seeded with logs of previous instant message conversations to generate
response text to incoming instant messages.

Installing
> python setup.py install

Note that Larvotto requires Python and the Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/)
networking libary.  If you install Twisted using a packaging system such as apt or
yum, the make sure you have the twisted.words library installed in addition to the
twisted base.


Usage
larvotto [-p password] [-l logdir] [-c chainlen] [-a altscrnm] screenname

-p password: Specify the password at the command line instead of being prompted
immediately following bot start

-l logdir: Directory containing Pidgin log files for the user being to base upon
For Windows users, this defaults to $HOME\Application Data\.purple\logs\aim
For *nix users, this defaults to $HOME/.purple/logs/aim

-c chainlen: The number of words to be used in the markov chain.  A smaller number
can result in nonsensical data and a higher number could result in a simple 
repetition of your previous statements.  These results can vary drasticly depending
on the size of your log files.  Our experimentation has shown a value of two or
three to perform well, but you should experiment yourself and have fun!

-a altscrnm: Specify that the markov chain should be seeded by statements made by
the specified screen name and not the user that the bot will log on as.  This is
useful for the case in which you don't want the bot to log in as your primary 
screen name, but you want to base its text on your previous conversations using
that name.
