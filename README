Larvotto is an AOL instant messanger bot that utilizes markov chains 
seeded with logs of previous instant message conversations to generate
response text to incoming instant messages.

Installing
> python setup.py install

Note that Larvotto requires Python and the Twisted (http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/)
networking libary.  If you install Twisted using a packaging system such as apt or
yum, the make sure you have the twisted.words library installed in addition to the
twisted base.


Usage
larvotto [-p password] [-l logdir] [-c chainlen] [-a altscrnm] screenname

-p password: Specify the password at the command line instead of being prompted
immediately following bot start

-l logdir: Directory containing Pidgin log files for the user being to base upon
For Windows users, this defaults to $HOME\Application Data\.purple\logs\aim
For *nix users, this defaults to $HOME/.purple/logs/aim

-c chainlen: The number of words to be used in the markov chain.  A smaller number
can result in nonsensical data and a higher number could result in a simple 
repetition of your previous statements.  These results can vary drasticly depending
on the size of your log files.  Our experimentation has shown a value of two or
three to perform well, but you should experiment yourself and have fun!

-a altscrnm: Specify that the markov chain should be seeded by statements made by
the specified screen name and not the user that the bot will log on as.  This is
useful for the case in which you don't want the bot to log in as your primary 
screen name, but you want to base its text on your previous conversations using
that name.

screenname: The AOL Instant Messanger screen name that the bot will use to log in



Implementation Notes
To generate text to send via instant messages, Larvotto parses a users Pidgin
log files to build up a list of uterences previously issued by the user.  This
body of text is then used to seed a Markov Chain used to generate "realistic" 
text.  When an incoming message is received, a sentence is generated using the
markvo chain and returned to the recipient.  The chain length command line 
argument specifies the length of the chain, or more specificly, given X words
what words have followed them and how often.  This is why a lower chain length
is more likely to result in gibberish and a longer length can result in a 
simple repition of sentences from the log files.
